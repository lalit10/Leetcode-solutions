#Implementation detail of line 19: To iterate the dictionary keys, I chose to use a generator object 
# to simply generate a single key: next(iter(self.cache)), which is equivalent to list(self.cache.keys())[0] or self.cache.items()[0][0]. 
# The reason behind doing this is because we can avoid a little bit of overhead required to generate a whole list of keys,
#  which can be more time-consuming when capacity is large; i.e. generate one key O(1) versus a whole list of keys O(k).

#Beginning with Python 3.7, Dictionary objects naturally store key-value pairs in the order of key insertion.
#  So we can very easily identify the least recently used item with a single iteration of the dictionary keys,
#  i.e. one can treat dictionary keys like a stack and the first key is the least-recently-used as long as we always
#  replace accessed keys back to the top of the stack.

#Another approach is to use OrderedDict from collections module.
# OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted.
# The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that: 
# A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the insertion order, and iterating it gives you the values in an arbitrary order.
# By contrast, the OrderedDict remembers the order keys were first inserted. 
# When iterating an ordered dictionary, the items are returned in the order their keys were first added.
# The popitem() method for ordered dictionaries returns and removes a (key, value) pair.
# The pairs are returned in LIFO order if last is true or FIFO order if false.
